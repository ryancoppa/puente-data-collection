## Ionic Framework

The Ionic framework allows for the creation of highly interactive, **cross-platform mobile applications** that can be deployed across iOS, Android, and Windows devices. These hybrid applications include native functionalities, exhaustive gestures, and customizable tools to enhance user-friendliness. Those powerful capabilities are brought to Ionic because it provides mobile-friendly `HTML`, `JS`, and `CSS` components to developers.

Some of its advantages are:

- Open source
- Code once, run on all mobile devices
- One programming language for all mobile OS
- Use of well-known web technologies
- A huge community

## Parse Server

**Parse Server** is an open source version of the Parse backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run `Node.js`. It works with the Express web application framework and can be added to existing web applications, or run by itself. Its repository is on [Github](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server).

Parse offer a backend to store data, push notifications, social media integration for our app etc. The features provided tend to be helpful in prototyping quickly.

- **General Purpose**: Open Source
- **Hosting**: Self-hosting or Parse Server Hosting providers. Supports local testing and development
- **Custom Code**: Supported via Cloud Code
- **Database**: Mongo DB
- **Push**: Support push notifications for Android, iOS. Also users can manage Push Notifications campaigns
- **Storage**: No restricted time limits and no file storage restrictions. Control over backup, restore and database indexes
- **Ideal for**: General purpose applications
